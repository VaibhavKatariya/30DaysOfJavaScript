# Day 17: Currency Converter ðŸ’±

## Project Overview

Today's project is a **Currency Converter**. This app allows users to convert amounts between different currencies using real-time exchange rates. It demonstrates working with APIs and handling user inputs.

## Features
- Input field for the amount to convert
- Dropdown menus for selecting source and target currencies
- Fetch real-time exchange rates from an API
- Display the converted amount
- Error handling for invalid inputs

## How It Works
1. The user enters an amount in the input field.
2. The user selects the source and target currencies from dropdown menus.
3. Upon clicking the "Convert" button, a request is sent to the currency exchange API to fetch the latest exchange rate.
4. The app calculates the converted amount and displays it on the screen.
5. If the input is invalid or the API request fails, an error message is shown.
