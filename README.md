# 30 Days of JavaScript 🚀

Welcome to my **30 Days of JavaScript** challenge! 🎉

## 📅 Challenge Overview

In this repository, I will upload a new JavaScript project every day for 30 consecutive days to enhance my understanding of JavaScript fundamentals. Although I had a small break between **3rd to 5th October**, I'm restarting the streak from **6th October** and will continue building.

## 🛠️ How It Works

- Each day, I'll tackle a new topic or project related to JavaScript.
- The projects will **start very simple and basic** to build core understanding and gradually move towards **more complex and challenging tasks**.
- I will upload my progress at the end of each day, ensuring I stay on track with the challenge.
- This repository serves as my daily journal and a record of my learning.


## 📁 Project Structure

Each day's project will be stored in a folder following this format:

```
Day-X/
│
├── index.html        # Main HTML file (if applicable)
├── style.css         # Main CSS  file (if applicable)
├── screenshot.png    # ScreenShot     (if applicable)
├── script.js         # JavaScript code for the project
└── README.md         # Description of the project and key learnings
```
